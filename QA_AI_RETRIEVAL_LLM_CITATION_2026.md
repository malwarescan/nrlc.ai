## 1. Query Match Analysis

### Target Query: "how do llms decide which content to cite in answers?"

**Current Coverage:**
- ✅ H1: "How LLMs Retrieve and Cite Web Content" (close match)
- ✅ FAQ: "How does AI decide what content to cite?" (exact match)
- ⚠️ Direct answer is brief (1 sentence in FAQ)
- ⚠️ Main content explains retrieval process but doesn't explicitly answer "how do they DECIDE"

**Gap Analysis:**
1. **Missing explicit decision criteria:** The page explains the retrieval process but doesn't clearly state the decision-making criteria
2. **FAQ answer is too brief:** Only one sentence, needs expansion
3. **No dedicated section** answering "how do they decide" - it's embedded in other sections

**Recommendations:**
- Add explicit section: "How LLMs Decide Which Content to Cite"
- Expand FAQ answer with decision criteria
- Add decision factors: segment scoring, relevance thresholds, citation confidence

## 7. Query-Specific Recommendations

### Priority 1: Direct Query Answer Enhancement

**Add New Section:**
```markdown
## How LLMs Decide Which Content to Cite

LLMs use a multi-factor decision system to determine which content segments to cite:

1. **Segment Relevance Score:** How closely the segment matches the query intent
2. **Completeness Score:** Whether the segment fully answers the question
3. **Confidence Threshold:** Minimum confidence level required for citation
4. **Source Authority:** Trust signals from the source domain
5. **Atomic Clarity:** Whether the segment can stand alone without context
6. **Verification Signals:** Structured data, entity consistency, canonical control

[Detailed explanation of each factor...]
```

**Expand FAQ Answer:**
```markdown
Q: How does AI decide what content to cite?

A: AI systems decide which content to cite based on a scoring system that evaluates:
- Segment relevance to the query (how closely it matches user intent)
- Completeness of the answer (whether it fully addresses the question)
- Atomic clarity (whether the segment can stand alone without context)
- Source authority signals (domain trust, entity consistency, structured data)
- Confidence thresholds (minimum score required for citation)

The highest-scoring segments that meet confidence thresholds are selected for citation. This is why prechunking matters: it ensures segments score highly on all these factors.
```

### Priority 2: Content Expansion

**Add Sections:**
1. **Decision Criteria Deep Dive** (500-800 words)
2. **Scoring Mechanisms Explained** (400-600 words)
3. **System-Specific Differences** (ChatGPT vs Google AI Overviews) (300-500 words)
4. **Real-World Examples** (2-3 case studies) (400-600 words)
5. **Troubleshooting Guide** (Why isn't my content being cited?) (300-500 words)
6. **Optimization Checklist** (Actionable steps) (200-300 words)

**Total Additional Content:** ~2,100-3,300 words  
**New Total:** ~3,300-4,800 words (optimal for expert guide)

### Priority 3: Visual Enhancements

**Add:**
1. **Flowchart:** LLM citation decision process
2. **Diagram:** Three-layer system visualization
3. **Comparison Table:** Different AI systems' citation criteria
4. **Example Visual:** Before/after prechunking comparison

### Priority 4: Internal Linking Enhancement

**Add Links To:**
- `/en-us/services/llm-seeding/` - Service that implements this

### Current Issues:
✅ **No technical errors found**  
✅ **Valid HTML structure**  
✅ **Valid schema markup**  
✅ **Proper canonical URL**
