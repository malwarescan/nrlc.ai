# Home Page Funnel Analysis & Redesign

## Current State Analysis

### Problems with Current Home Page:
1. **Too Technical** - Focuses on semantic infrastructure, data layers, SQL ontologies
2. **Enterprise-Focused** - Language like "semantic layer", "data virtualization", "knowledge graph"
3. **Not Consumer-Friendly** - Assumes technical knowledge
4. **Weak Value Prop** - Doesn't clearly state what problem we solve for businesses
5. **No Clear Funnel** - Jumps between different concepts without a clear path
6. **Missing AI SEO Focus** - Buried under technical infrastructure talk

### What's Missing:
- Clear problem statement (why traditional SEO isn't enough)
- Consumer-friendly language
- Focus on ChatGPT and AI Overviews visibility
- Simple value proposition
- Clear call-to-action funnel
- Social proof/results
