      <h1 style="margin: 0 0 1rem 0; font-size: 2rem; color: #000080;">The GEO-16 Framework: Six Principles, Sixteen Pillars</h1>
      <p class="lead" style="font-size: 1.2rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">The theoretical foundation of AI citation optimization rests on six core principles, each mapped to specific, measurable signals that determine citation success in generative search engines.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Principle 1: Metadata Completeness -->
  <div class="window" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
    <div class="title-bar">
      <div class="title-bar-text">Principle 1: Metadata Completeness</div>
    </div>
    <div class="window-body">
      <h2 style="color: #000080; margin-top: 0;">Principle 1: Metadata Completeness</h2>
      <p>AI engines rely heavily on metadata to understand and categorize content. Complete metadata provides context that helps engines determine relevance and authority. This principle encompasses three critical pillars:</p>
      
      <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #000080;">Pillar 1: Title Tag Optimization</h3>
      <p>Effective title tags clearly communicate the page's primary topic while remaining within optimal length limits. AI engines analyze title tags for keyword relevance, semantic clarity, and uniqueness. Titles should be descriptive rather than promotional, focusing on what the content actually delivers.</p>
      
      <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #000080;">Pillar 2: Meta Description Quality</h3>
      <p>Meta descriptions serve as summaries that help AI engines understand content scope and value. High-quality descriptions are concise, accurate, and include relevant keywords naturally. They should provide enough detail for AI engines to assess content relevance without being overly promotional.</p>
      
      <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #000080;">Pillar 3: Structured Data Implementation</h3>
      <p>Structured data provides explicit information about content type, author, publication date, and other metadata. AI engines use this data to understand content structure and make citation decisions. Implementation should follow schema.org standards and include all relevant properties for the content type.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Principle 2: Content Freshness -->
  <div class="window" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
    <div class="title-bar">
      <div class="title-bar-text">Principle 2: Content Freshness</div>
    </div>
    <div class="window-body">
      <h2 style="color: #000080; margin-top: 0;">Principle 2: Content Freshness</h2>
      <p>Fresh content signals relevance and accuracy to AI engines. This principle emphasizes the importance of recent publication dates, regular updates, and current information. It includes two key pillars:</p>
      
      <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #000080;">Pillar 4: Publication Date Visibility</h3>
      <p>Clear publication dates help AI engines assess content currency and relevance. Dates should be prominently displayed and machine-readable, using standardized formats that AI engines can easily parse. Regular updates signal ongoing relevance and accuracy.</p>
      
      <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #000080;">Pillar 5: Update Frequency</h3>
      <p>Regular content updates demonstrate ongoing relevance and accuracy. AI engines favor content that shows signs of recent maintenance and updates. This includes both substantive content changes and minor corrections or improvements.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Principle 3: Semantic Structure -->
  <div class="window" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
    <div class="title-bar">
      <div class="title-bar-text">Principle 3: Semantic Structure</div>
    </div>
    <div class="window-body">
      <h2 style="color: #000080; margin-top: 0;">Principle 3: Semantic Structure</h2>
      <p>Clear semantic structure helps AI engines understand content organization and extract key information. This principle focuses on HTML structure and content organization:</p>
      
      <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #000080;">Pillar 6: Heading Hierarchy</h3>
      <p>Proper heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3) creates logical content structure that AI engines can easily parse. Headings should be descriptive and reflect the content's organizational structure. Each heading level should represent a clear content section or subsection.</p>
      
      <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #000080;">Pillar 7: List and Table Structure</h3>
      <p>Well-structured lists and tables help AI engines extract key information efficiently. Lists should use proper HTML markup (ul, ol, li) and tables should include appropriate headers and semantic markup. This structure enables AI engines to understand relationships between different pieces of information.</p>
      
      <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #000080;">Pillar 8: Paragraph Organization</h3>
      <p>Logical paragraph organization improves content readability for both humans and AI engines. Paragraphs should focus on single topics and flow logically from one to the next. Clear topic sentences help AI engines understand paragraph content and relevance.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Principle 4: Entity Clarity -->
  <div class="window" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
    <div class="title-bar">
      <div class="title-bar-text">Principle 4: Entity Clarity</div>
    </div>
    <div class="window-body">
      <h2 style="color: #000080; margin-top: 0;">Principle 4: Entity Clarity</h2>
      <p>Clear entity identification helps AI engines understand the people, places, and concepts discussed in content. This principle ensures that key entities are explicitly identified and properly contextualized:</p>
      
      <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #000080;">Pillar 9: Named Entity Recognition</h3>
      <p>Content should clearly identify key entities such as people, organizations, locations, and concepts. AI engines use named entity recognition to understand content context and make citation decisions. Entities should be introduced clearly and consistently throughout the content.</p>
      
      <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #000080;">Pillar 10: Entity Relationships</h3>
      <p>Content should explain relationships between different entities, helping AI engines understand context and connections. This includes organizational hierarchies, geographical relationships, and conceptual connections that provide additional context for citation decisions.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Principle 5: Verification Signals -->
  <div class="window" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
    <div class="title-bar">
      <div class="title-bar-text">Principle 5: Verification Signals</div>
    </div>
    <div class="window-body">
      <h2 style="color: #000080; margin-top: 0;">Principle 5: Verification Signals</h2>
      <p>Verification signals help AI engines assess content credibility and authority. This principle focuses on elements that demonstrate content reliability:</p>
      
      <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #000080;">Pillar 11: Author Credentials</h3>
      <p>Clear author information and credentials help AI engines assess content authority. Authors should be identified with relevant qualifications, affiliations, and expertise areas. This information helps AI engines determine content reliability and expertise level.</p>
      
      <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #000080;">Pillar 12: Source Attribution</h3>
      <p>Proper source attribution demonstrates content reliability and enables verification. Citations should be clear, complete, and accessible. AI engines use source attribution to assess content credibility and make citation decisions.</p>
      
      <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #000080;">Pillar 13: Fact-Checking Indicators</h3>
      <p>Content should include indicators of fact-checking and accuracy verification. This includes citations, references, and other signals that demonstrate content reliability. AI engines prioritize content that shows evidence of verification and accuracy.</p>
