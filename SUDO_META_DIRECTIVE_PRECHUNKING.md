SUDO META DIRECTIVE — PRECHUNKING CONTENT FOR SEO, AI OVERVIEWS, AND LLM RETRIEVAL

Scope: nrlc.ai — all blogs, guides, documentation, and future content systems
Priority: CRITICAL
Mode: ENFORCEMENT (not advisory)

⸻

OBJECTIVE

All content MUST be authored, structured, and validated for segment-level retrieval, not page-level readability.

The goal is to maximize:
	•	Google AI Overview inclusion
	•	LLM answer retrieval
	•	Verbatim citation eligibility
	•	Zero-click visibility

Narrative writing is explicitly disallowed unless it satisfies retrieval constraints.

⸻

CORE DEFINITION

Prechunking is the discipline of structuring content before writing so that every section is:
	•	Atomic
	•	Self-contained
	•	Independently retrievable
	•	Independently citable

Retrieval systems do not read essays.
They extract answers.

⸻

PROBLEM STATEMENT (WHY THIS EXISTS)

Most ranking content optimizes for:
	•	Human readability
	•	Bounce rate
	•	Scroll depth

This is insufficient.

Modern search systems (Google, AI Overviews, LLMs) retrieve segments, not pages.

If content cannot be cleanly segmented, it will not be retrieved or cited.

⸻

RETRIEVAL REALITY MODEL (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Search + LLM retrieval operates as follows:
	1.	Query interpretation
	2.	Candidate document selection
	3.	Segment extraction
	4.	Segment scoring for answer quality
	5.	Segment citation or surfacing

Failure at step 3 or 4 = zero visibility, regardless of rankings.

⸻

GLOBAL CONTENT RULES (APPLY TO ALL PAGES)
	•	Pages MUST be composed of discrete chunks
	•	Each chunk MUST answer exactly ONE question
	•	Each chunk MUST be understandable in isolation
	•	Each chunk MUST be quotable verbatim
	•	No chunk may depend on another chunk for meaning

If any rule is violated, the content FAILS.

⸻

THE NRLC PRECHUNKING FRAMEWORK (MANDATORY)

⸻

STEP 1 — QUESTION INVENTORY FIRST (BEFORE WRITING)

Before any content is authored:
	•	Enumerate the exact questions the page must answer
	•	Each question becomes exactly ONE chunk
	•	No combined questions
	•	No narrative sequencing

Example question inventory:
	•	What is prechunking in SEO
	•	How is prechunking different from content chunking
	•	How prechunking affects LLM retrieval
	•	Optimal chunk size for AI indexing
	•	Common prechunking mistakes

No exceptions. No improvisation.

⸻

STEP 2 — ATOMICITY ENFORCEMENT

Each chunk MUST pass this test:

If this section were extracted alone and shown to a user, would it still fully answer the question?

If NO:
	•	Split the chunk
	•	Or rewrite it

Atomic chunks MUST:
	•	Never reference other sections
	•	Never use pronouns like "this", "above", "earlier"
	•	Never summarize other chunks
	•	Never rely on page context

⸻

STEP 3 — DETERMINISTIC, QUERY-SHAPED HEADERS

Headers are retrieval anchors.

Allowed headers:
	•	What is prechunking in SEO
	•	How prechunking improves AI citation
	•	Does Google index content chunks separately

Disallowed headers:
	•	Understanding prechunking
	•	Why this matters
	•	The future of SEO content

Headers MUST resemble real search queries.
Cleverness is prohibited.

⸻

STEP 4 — CHUNK SIZE CONSTRAINTS (STRICT)

Each chunk MUST adhere to:
	•	Ideal length: 40–120 words
	•	Hard maximum: ~150 words
	•	Exactly one idea per chunk

Overlong chunks will be truncated, diluted, or ignored by retrieval systems.

⸻

STEP 5 — NARRATIVE GLUE ELIMINATION

The following are explicitly FORBIDDEN:
	•	"As mentioned earlier"
	•	"In conclusion"
	•	"This shows that"
	•	Transitional filler
	•	Essay-style flow

Each chunk MUST read like a StackOverflow answer, not a blog paragraph.

⸻

STEP 6 — CITATION TEST (FINAL GATE)

Every chunk MUST pass this test:

Could this paragraph be quoted verbatim as an answer to a question without clarification?

If NO:
	•	Rewrite
	•	Or split

This is the single most important rule.

⸻

PRECHUNKED VS TRADITIONAL CONTENT (REFERENCE MODEL)

Traditional SEO:
	•	Narrative flow
	•	Paragraph transitions
	•	Topic coverage
	•	Page-level ranking
	•	Human-first

Prechunked SEO:
	•	Modular answers
	•	Independent chunks
	•	Question coverage
	•	Segment-level retrieval
	•	Machine-first, human-compatible

Prechunking does NOT replace good writing.
It replaces essay thinking.

⸻

COMMON FAILURE MODES (AUTO-REJECT)
	•	Writing first, chunking later
	•	Overlong "pillar" sections
	•	Clever or abstract headers
	•	Multiple answers inside one chunk

Rule: One chunk, one answer.

⸻

VALIDATION CHECKLIST (REQUIRED BEFORE PUBLISH)

Content PASSES only if ALL are true:
	•	Any section can be copied alone and still make sense
	•	Headers map directly to search queries
	•	No section depends on another section
	•	LLMs can quote content without adding clarification

If any check fails, content MUST be revised.

⸻

NRLC POSITIONING PRINCIPLE

Modern SEO is no longer about pages.
It is about retrievable facts.

NRLC content MUST be treated as:
	•	Structured data for machines first
	•	Human-readable second

This is how visibility is earned in:
	•	Google AI Overviews
	•	LLM answers
	•	Zero-click results

Prechunking is not a tactic.
It is infrastructure.

⸻

EXTENSIONS (OPTIONAL, BUT COMPATIBLE)
	•	JSON-LD–aware chunk blocks
	•	CMS-level prechunked templates
	•	Competitive teardown against non-prechunked pages
	•	Internal linking rules between atomic chunks

⸻
