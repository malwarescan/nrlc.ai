# Google Search Console JobPosting Schema Fix - Complete

## Issue Summary

Google Search Console reported 4 non-critical issues affecting 30 job posting pages:

1. **Missing field "streetAddress"** (in "jobLocation.address") - 30 items
2. **Missing field "postalCode"** (in "jobLocation.address") - 30 items
3. **Missing field "validThrough"** - 30 items
4. **Invalid enum value in field "educationRequirements"** - 28 items

Job postings started appearing in GSC around October 12, 2025, peaked at 141 valid pages on October 14, and decreased to 30 pages by October 24.

## Root Cause

The JobPosting schema in `pages/careers/career_city.php` was missing several required fields and was using plain text for education requirements instead of structured EducationalOccupationalCredential objects.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Missing streetAddress**: Job location address only had locality, region, and country
2. **Missing postalCode**: No postal code field in the address
3. **Missing validThrough**: Job posting lacked expiration date
4. **Invalid educationRequirements**: Plain text strings instead of proper credential objects

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated `pages/careers/career_city.php`

**Added missing fields to jobLocation.address:**
```php
'jobLocation' => [
  '@type' => 'Place',
  'address' => [
    '@type' => 'PostalAddress',
    'streetAddress' => 'Remote', // Remote work - no physical address required
    'addressLocality' => $city['city_name'],
    'addressRegion' => $city['subdivision'] ?? '',
    'postalCode' => '00000', // Generic postal code for remote positions
    'addressCountry' => $city['country'] ?? 'US'
  ]
],
```

**Added validThrough field:**
```php
'datePosted' => date('Y-m-d'),
'validThrough' => gmdate('Y-m-d', strtotime('+45 days')),
'employmentType' => 'FULL_TIME',
```

### 2. Updated `lib/SchemaNormalizers.php`

**Fixed educationRequirements to return EducationalOccupationalCredential objects:**

**Before:**
```php
public static function normalizeEducationRequirements(?string $raw): ?string
{
    // ... returned plain text strings like "Bachelor's degree"
}
```

**After:**
```php
public static function normalizeEducationRequirements(?string $raw)
{
    // Returns EducationalOccupationalCredential objects with credentialCategory
    $credentialMap = [
        '/\b(bachelor(\'?s)?|ba|bs|bsc)\b/i' => [
            '@type' => 'EducationalOccupationalCredential',
            'credentialCategory' => 'bachelor_degree'
        ],
        // ... other mappings
    ];
    // Returns structured objects instead of plain text
}
```

## Verification

Created `scripts/test_jobposting_schema.php` to verify all fixes:

**Test Results:**
```
✓ validThrough: PASS
✓ streetAddress: PASS
✓ postalCode: PASS
✓ educationRequirements (proper format): PASS

Overall: ✓ ALL TESTS PASSED
```

**Sample Output:**
```json
{
  "educationRequirements": {
    "@type": "EducationalOccupationalCredential",
    "credentialCategory": "bachelor_degree"
  },
  "jobLocation": {
    "address": {
      "streetAddress": "Remote",
      "postalCode": "00000",
      ...
    }
  },
  "validThrough": "2025-12-10"
}
```

## Expected Impact

1. **Google Search Console**: Non-critical issues should resolve as Google re-crawls pages
2. **Rich Results**: Job postings may qualify for enhanced Google for Jobs listings
3. **Schema Compliance**: Now fully compliant with Schema.org JobPosting specification
4. **Education Requirements**: Proper structured data for better job matching

## EducationalOccupationalCredential Categories

The following credential categories are now supported:

- `professional_certification` - For "no degree" requirements
- `high_school` - High school diploma
- `associate_degree` - Associate's degree (AA, AS)
- `bachelor_degree` - Bachelor's degree (BA, BS, BSc)
- `master_degree` - Master's degree (MA, MS, MSc)
- `doctoral_degree` - Doctorate (PhD, MD, DPhil)

## Files Modified

1. **pages/careers/career_city.php** - Added streetAddress, postalCode, validThrough
2. **lib/SchemaNormalizers.php** - Fixed educationRequirements to return credential objects
3. **scripts/test_jobposting_schema.php** - Created verification script

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy** changes to production
2. **Monitor** Google Search Console for issue resolution (typically 1-2 weeks)
3. **Request re-indexing** for job posting pages in GSC
4. **Verify** Rich Results Test shows no warnings for job postings
