# Neural Command: Content Self-Assessment Checklist (2026 Edition)

**Purpose:** Ensure pages linked in `llms.txt` pass Google's updated **Helpful Content** standards optimized for **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)**.

**Context:** Google uses specialized AI models (like Gemini 3) to mathematically evaluate "Information Gain"—rewarding content that provides unique data or insights not found elsewhere.

---

## 1. Information Gain & "Experience"

### Questions to Ask:

- [ ] **Original Data:** Does the page include proprietary benchmarks, survey results, or case studies from Neural Command's own work?
- [ ] **Unique Perspective:** Does the research offer a "bonus" of information (Information Gain) that competing agencies or AI-generated summaries lack?
- [ ] **First-Hand Proof:** Does the content use "I" or "We" perspectives with original images (e.g., actual result screenshots) to prove real-world experience?

### Why This Matters:
AI engines in 2026 suffer from **"Semantic Noise"**—grammatically correct AI content that offers no new information. Pages with original data and first-hand experience signal Neural Command as a **Source of Truth**, increasing "Answer Inclusion Rate" and "Share of Influence" in AI-generated overviews.

---

## 2. Answer-First Architecture (AEO)

### Questions to Ask:

- [ ] **Extractor-Friendly:** Is the primary answer to the user's intent provided in the first 1–2 sentences of the relevant section?
- [ ] **Declarative Language:** Does the content use short, fact-led, declarative statements (max 15–20 words) that AI agents can easily cite?
- [ ] **Modular Formatting:** Are subheadings framed as questions where appropriate, making the section "self-contained" for AI chunking?

### Why This Matters:
Answer-First Architecture ensures AI agents can extract the primary answer immediately. Modular formatting makes sections "self-contained" for AI chunking, improving citation frequency.

## 3. E-E-A-T & Trust Signals

### Questions to Ask:

- [ ] **Author Transparency:** Does every research piece include a real byline with a bio linking to Joel Maldonado's credentials and LinkedIn?
- [ ] **Citation Depth:** Are external sources cited with specific names and dates rather than generic "research shows" phrasing?
- [ ] **Safety & Accuracy:** Is there a "How we wrote this" note or a "Verified by" section on high-impact research (YMYL) pages?

### Why This Matters:
E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) is critical for Knowledge Graph building. Author transparency and citation depth signal Neural Command's research authority to both humans and AI systems.

---

## 4. Entity Clarity & Definition Locks

### Questions to Ask:

- [ ] **Definition Lock:** Does the page include an explicit definition of key terms immediately after the H1 using `<dfn>` tags and `DefinedTerm` schema?
- [ ] **Entity Repetition:** Is the primary entity (Neural Command, GEO, AEO) mentioned 5+ times throughout the page for strong entity consolidation?
- [ ] **Schema Markup:** Does the page include `DefinedTermSet` and `DefinedTerm` schema for key concepts?

### Why This Matters:
Definition locks provide immediate entity clarity for AI extraction. Entity repetition ensures strong Knowledge Graph consolidation. Schema markup signals explicit meaning to AI systems.

---

## 5. Visual Hierarchy & Scannability

### Questions to Ask:

- [ ] **Clear Headings:** Are H2/H3 headings descriptive and scannable (not clever or ambiguous)?
- [ ] **Visual Separation:** Are key sections visually separated with borders, backgrounds, or spacing?
- [ ] **CTAs Prominent:** Are CTAs strategically placed (hero, mid-page, bottom) with clear visual hierarchy?

### Why This Matters:
Clear visual hierarchy helps both humans and AI agents understand content structure. Prominent CTAs improve conversion rates.

---

## 6. Internal Linking & Navigation

### Questions to Ask:

- [ ] **Contextual Links:** Are internal links placed contextually within content (not just in sidebars or footers)?
- [ ] **Link Text:** Does link text use descriptive keywords that signal relevance (not "click here" or generic text)?
- [ ] **Related Content:** Are related research pages or services linked to create topic clusters?

### Why This Matters:
Contextual internal linking creates topic clusters that strengthen entity relationships in the Knowledge Graph. Descriptive link text signals relevance to AI systems.
