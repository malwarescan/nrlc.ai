# Homepage Title Optimization Analysis

## Current Title
**"Joel Maldonado | SEO, AEO, GEO & AI Search Research"** (57 characters)

### Issues
1. ❌ **Personal name first** - Low search volume, not what people search for
2. ❌ **"AI Search Research"** - Should be "AI Search Optimization" (higher intent, more searches)
3. ❌ **Acronyms (AEO, GEO)** - Lower search volume than full terms
4. ❌ **Missing brand** - "Neural Command" not prominent
