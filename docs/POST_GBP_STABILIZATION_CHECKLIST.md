## Week 1: Lock & Observe

**DO:**
- ✅ Do not change identity fields
- ✅ Do not rename services
- ✅ Do not restructure URLs
- ✅ Submit sitemap if not already
- ✅ Force re-crawl of 3 core service pages

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Make identity changes
- ❌ Rename or rebrand services
- ❌ Change URL structure

---

## Week 2: Reinforce (No Expansion)

**DO:**
- ✅ Add proof artifacts only (screenshots, metrics)
- ✅ Tighten copy clarity (shorten, don't add ideas)
- ✅ Publish 1 conservative explainer article
- ✅ Link explainer from all service pages

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Add new services
- ❌ Expand service descriptions
- ❌ Introduce new concepts

---

## Week 3: Authority Echo

**DO:**
- ✅ Share explainer on LinkedIn (plain framing)
- ✅ Reference it in one technical discussion (Slack, forum, internal share)
- ✅ Monitor engagement signals

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Chase backlinks aggressively
- ❌ Over-promote or spam
- ❌ Add promotional language

---

## Week 4: Evaluate

**DO:**
- ✅ Review GSC signals (see EXACT_SIGNALS_TO_WATCH_IN_GSC.md)
- ✅ Prepare second explainer only if signals improve
- ✅ Document findings

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ No new services
- ❌ No new experimental pages
- ❌ No changes to core structure

---

## General Rules (All 30 Days)

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Rebrand language
- ❌ Add clever positioning
- ❌ Introduce new schema types
- ❌ Launch tools or demos on service pages

**Remember:** Stability is the ranking catalyst here.

## Success Criteria

After 30 days, if:
- ✅ Impressions are rising
- ✅ Indexing is stable
- ✅ Queries are more commercial

Then classification succeeded and ranking improvements follow.

If not, the issue is no longer identity. It becomes authority and external validation, not on-site structure.

## Next Steps (After 30 Days)

When ready, the next move is:
- External corroboration
- Case publication
- Controlled backlink acquisition

But you were right to start here. This is the gate everyone skips.
