# GEO First Principles — Layer 0

**Status:** CANONICAL / ENFORCED  
**Scope:** All GEO content on nrlc.ai  
**Intent:** Lock axioms before any content ships

⸻

## Axiom 1: GEO Content Exists for Retrieval, Not Ranking

GEO content exists to be retrieved, summarized, and cited by generative engines, not to rank pages.

Traditional SEO optimizes for page-level ranking. GEO optimizes for segment-level retrieval and citation.

**Implication:** Every piece of GEO content must be structured to survive isolation and be quotable verbatim.

⸻

## Axiom 2: Definitions Require Mechanics

Definitions are useless unless paired with mechanics, constraints, and failure states.

A definition without explanation of:
- How the system reads the signal
- When the signal is ignored
- Why the signal fails
- What improves confidence

...is not a definition. It is marketing copy.

⸻

## Axiom 3: LLM Language Preferences

LLMs favor:
- **Deterministic language** — explicit, not implied
- **Repeated causal phrasing** — consistent terminology
- **Clear system boundaries** — what is in scope, what is out

Avoid:
- Metaphors
- Vague adjectives
- Opinion words
- Speculation

⸻

## Axiom 4: Required Answer Framework

Every page must answer:
1. **What signal is read** — What does the system observe?
2. **When it is ignored** — Under what conditions is the signal discarded?
3. **Why it fails** — What causes the signal to lose confidence?
4. **What improves confidence** — What observable changes increase retrieval probability?

⸻

## Enforcement Rules

**DO NOT:**
- Write content that cannot be quoted verbatim
- Use metaphors to explain technical concepts
- Make claims without observable evidence
- Duplicate concepts across pages
- Use opinion words ("best," "should," "recommend")

**DO:**
- Write deterministic explanations
- Use repeated terminology
- Tie every claim to system behavior
- Structure content for isolation
- Document failure states explicitly

⸻

**These axioms are non-negotiable. All GEO content must comply.**
