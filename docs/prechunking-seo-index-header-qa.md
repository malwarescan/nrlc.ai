- Lists what it does NOT work with (low quality, incorrect facts)

**All content aligns with header intent.** ✅

---

#### 5. "What It Does Not Guarantee"
**Status:** ✅ **PASS**

**Analysis:**
- Clear expectation management
- Logical progression: Boundaries → Outcomes
- Prevents overpromising
- Intent: Expectation Management

**Content Check:**
- Does not guarantee rankings ✅
- Does not guarantee AI citations ✅
- Does not guarantee traffic/conversions ✅
- Clarifies: ensures availability, not retrieval ✅

**All content aligns with header intent.** ✅

---

#### 6. "Related Documentation"
**Status:** ✅ **PASS**

**Analysis:**
- Clear navigation/reference section
- Appropriate placement after core content
- Introductory text: "For implementation details, see:" ✅
- Lists 7 documentation pages with descriptions ✅
- Intent: Navigation/Reference

**Content Check:**
- Links to Core Concepts, Croutons, Precogs, Workflow, Failure Modes, Measurement, Doctrine

- Intent: Navigation/Reference

**Content Check:**

**All content aligns with header intent.** ✅

---

#### 8. "Core Axioms"
**Status:** ✅ **PASS** (with placement recommendation)

**Analysis:**
- Clear foundational principles section
- Lists 5 core axioms
- Closing statement: "Any practice that contradicts these axioms is not prechunking SEO" ✅
- Intent: Doctrine/Foundational Rules

**Content Check:**
- 5 axioms listed (all align with discipline)
- Axioms are declarative and clear
- Closing reinforces authority

**All content aligns with header intent.** ✅

**Placement Recommendation:**
- Currently at end (after navigation)
- Could be moved earlier (after "What It Replaces" or "What It Does Not Do")
- Axioms are foundational and might be better positioned before navigation
- **However:** Current placement as "closing anchor" is also valid
- **Decision:** Keep current placement (acts as foundational anchor at end)

---

## HEADER HIERARCHY CHECK

**Structure:**
```
H1: Prechunking SEO
  H2: What Is Prechunking SEO
  H2: What Problem It Solves
  H2: What It Replaces
  H2: What It Does Not Do
  H2: What It Does Not Guarantee
  H2: Related Documentation
  H2: Related Resources
  H2: Core Axioms
```

**Status:** ✅ **PASS**

**Analysis:**
- Correct hierarchy (H1 → H2, no H3s needed)
- No skipped levels
- All headers are siblings under H1 (correct for documentation index)
- No orphaned headers

---

## LOGICAL FLOW CHECK

**Current Order:**
1. Definition (What Is)
2. Problem (What Problem It Solves)
3. Positioning (What It Replaces)
4. Scope Boundaries (What It Does Not Do)
5. Outcome Disclaimers (What It Does Not Guarantee)
6. Navigation (Related Documentation)
7. Navigation (Related Resources)
8. Foundational Rules (Core Axioms)

**Status:** ✅ **PASS**

**Analysis:**
- Logical progression: Definition → Problem → Positioning → Boundaries → Outcomes → Navigation → Rules
- Each section builds on previous
- Negative framing (Does Not Do, Does Not Guarantee) appropriately placed after positive framing
- Navigation sections appropriately placed after core content
- Core Axioms as closing anchor is valid (reinforces foundation)

**Alternative Flow Consideration:**
- Could move "Core Axioms" earlier (after "What It Replaces")
- Would provide foundation before boundaries
- **Decision:** Current flow is acceptable (axioms as closing anchor reinforces discipline)

---

## INTENT ALIGNMENT CHECK

**Page Intent:** Documentation index defining Prechunking SEO discipline

**Header Intent Mapping:**
- ✅ H1: Discipline name (definitional)
- ✅ H2: Definition section (definitional)
- ✅ H2: Problem section (justification)
- ✅ H2: Positioning section (contrast)
- ✅ H2: Scope boundaries (boundary setting)
- ✅ H2: Outcome disclaimers (expectation management)
- ✅ H2: Navigation (reference)
- ✅ H2: Navigation (reference)
- ✅ H2: Foundational rules (doctrine)

**Status:** ✅ **PASS** (100% intent-aligned)

---

## CLARITY CHECK

**All Headers:**
- ✅ Declarative (not questions, not vague)
- ✅ Self-contained (interpretable without context)
- ✅ Specific (not generic)
- ✅ Technical (appropriate for engineering discipline)
- ✅ No marketing language
- ✅ No ambiguity

**Status:** ✅ **PASS** (100% clear)

---

## UNIQUENESS CHECK

**All Headers:**
- ✅ No duplicate headers
- ✅ Each header serves distinct purpose
- ✅ No semantic overlap

**Status:** ✅ **PASS** (100% unique)

---

## CONTENT-HEADER ALIGNMENT CHECK

**For each H2, verified:**
- ✅ Content matches header intent
- ✅ Content expands on header topic
- ✅ No content contradicts header
- ✅ Content is appropriately scoped

**Status:** ✅ **PASS** (100% aligned)

---

## ISSUES FOUND

**Critical Issues:** 0  
**Minor Issues:** 0  
**Enhancement Opportunities:** 1

### Enhancement Opportunity #1: Core Axioms Placement

**Issue:** Core Axioms section is placed at the end (after navigation sections)

**Current Impact:** Low (placement is valid, just not optimal)

**Recommendation:** Consider moving "Core Axioms" earlier in the flow (after "What It Replaces" or "What It Does Not Do") to provide foundational context before boundaries and outcomes.

**Rationale:**
- Axioms are foundational and should inform boundaries
- Earlier placement would strengthen "What It Does Not Do" and "What It Does Not Guarantee" sections
- However, current placement as closing anchor is also valid

**Priority:** P3 (optional enhancement)

**Decision:** Keep current placement (axioms as closing anchor reinforces discipline foundation)

---

## SUMMARY

**Total Headers:** 9 (1 H1, 8 H2s)  
**Headers Passing:** 9 ✅  
**Headers with Issues:** 0  
**Enhancement Opportunities:** 1 (optional)

**Overall Status:** ✅ **PASS**

**All headers:**
- ✅ Make logical sense
- ✅ Follow correct hierarchy
- ✅ Align with page intent

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. ✅ **Keep current header structure** - All headers are appropriate
