# Training Observation Window

**Status:** ✅ PASS (INTENT-SAFE, SEO-SAFE)  
**Observation Period:** 2-3 weeks from implementation  
**Start Date:** 2025-01-27  
**End Date:** ~2025-02-17 (3 weeks)

---

## QA Verdict

**Status:** TRAINING OFFERING — PASS (INTENT-SAFE, SEO-SAFE)

Nothing needs to be undone. Nothing needs to be "tightened." This is the rare case where the correct next move is restraint.

---

## What Was Done Right

### ✅ Correct Placement
- Training lives on `nrlc.ai`, not `nrlcmd.com`
- Preserves research/education vs execution boundary

### ✅ Correct Taxonomy
- `EducationalOccupationalProgram` for the hub (`/training/`)
- `Course` for one-on-one (`/training/one-on-one/`)
- **NO** Service, Offer, or LocalBusiness schema
- Prevents Google from misclassifying training as agency service

### ✅ Classifier Copy is Explicit
- Clearly states what this is
- Clearly states what it is not
- Explains why execution is separate
- Language does real SEO work

### ✅ Navigation Placement
- Training sits alongside Knowledge/Research
- **NOT** near Contact or Services
- Parallel, not downstream

### ✅ Clean Commits
- Atomic and reversible
- Structure + routing (commit 1)
- Classifier copy (commit 2)
- How Google should ingest new intent

---

## Observation Mode (2-3 Weeks)

### DO NOT:
- ❌ Add team training yet
- ❌ Add pricing tables
- ❌ Add scheduling widgets
- ❌ Cross-link to services
- ❌ Add testimonials or outcomes
- ❌ Modify existing training pages
- ❌ Add new training formats

**Let Google classify the new intent in isolation.**

---

## What to Watch (Lightly)

**You're not looking for conversions yet.**

### Indexing Signals
- [ ] `/training/` indexed
- [ ] `/training/one-on-one/` indexed
- [ ] No duplicate indexing issues

### Query Shapes (Google Search Console)
Watch for queries shifting toward:
- [ ] "AI search training"
- [ ] "AEO training"
- [ ] "SEO training for teams"
- [ ] "GEO training"
- [ ] "modern search training"

### Service Page Stability
- [ ] No drop in service page impressions
- [ ] Service pages remain stable
- [ ] This confirms no cannibalization

### Success Criteria
✅ Training pages indexed cleanly  
✅ Service pages remain stable  
✅ Query shapes shift toward training intent  
✅ No service page impression drops

**If all above are true, the separation worked.**

---

## Why Wait on Team Training

Even though it's designed, **wait 2-3 weeks**.

**Why:**
- Adding multiple training formats at once muddies classification
- Google needs to "decide" what `/training/` is before expansion
- One clear exemplar page (one-on-one) is enough initially

**Safe to add after observation window:**
- `/training/team-training/` (same model, same schema)

---

## Next Safe Expansions (After Observation)

When the window is complete, correct next options are:

1. ✅ Add team training page (same model, same schema)
2. ✅ Add Course schema to team training only
3. ✅ Add a single training FAQ (already drafted)
4. ✅ Add training resources (slides, reading lists) — optional

**Do NOT jump to:**
- ❌ Pricing grids
- ❌ Booking flows
- ❌ Testimonials
- ❌ Outcome promises

---

## Final Check

**Right now, Google will see:**
- `nrlc.ai` = research + education authority
- `training` = skill transfer
- `nrlcmd.com` = execution vendor

**That is exactly the separation you want.**
