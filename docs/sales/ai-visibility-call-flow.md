# AI Visibility Sales Call Flow

**Purpose:** Match the page narrative and guide sales conversations to align with the diagnostic positioning.

**Total Duration:** 15 minutes

---

## 0:00–1:30: Set Frame (AI is Already in Funnel)

**Opening:**
"Before we dive in, I want to frame something: Your customers are already asking AI about [industry] before they ever search Google. AI assistants like ChatGPT answer questions like '[prompt 1]' and '[prompt 2]' directly. Whoever AI trusts becomes the default option. That's what we measure and fix."

**Key Points:**
- AI is already in the funnel
- This isn't about future-proofing; it's about current visibility
- The problem is observable, not theoretical

---

## 1:30–4:00: Show Their Category Prompt Set

**Action:** Pull up the industry-specific prompt list from the page.

**Script:**
"Let me show you the exact questions AI is answering in your industry. These are the prompts we test: [list 5 prompts]. When someone asks AI '[primary prompt]', what does it say? Does it mention your firm, or does it default to generic advice?"

**Key Points:**
- Use the exact prompts from the industry page
- Ask them to test one prompt themselves (if on call)
- Establish that AI answers these questions directly

---

## 4:00–7:00: Explain "AI Comparison" (Generic vs Preferred)

**Action:** Reference the AI Comparison section from the page.

**Script:**
"Here's the difference between how AI explains decisions today versus how it should. [Show generic answer] This is what AI says when signals are unclear. [Show preferred answer] This is what AI says when signals are structured and trustworthy. The difference is extractability, entity consistency, and structured reinforcement."

**Key Points:**
- Use the exact comparison from the page
- Explain the three signals: extractability, entity consistency, structured reinforcement
- Make it clear this is observable, not theoretical

---

## 7:00–10:00: Describe the Audit Deliverable (Diagnostic, Not Contract)

**Action:** Explain the AI Visibility & Trust Audit.

**Script:**
"The AI Visibility & Trust Audit is a diagnostic that measures how AI systems describe your business and identifies the exact signals needed to become the trusted recommendation. You receive: a breakdown of how AI currently describes your firm, where competitors are being favored, what signals are missing or unclear, and a prioritized fix list. This is a diagnostic, not a contract. We're not promising to control AI output or guarantee rankings. We're identifying what needs to change."

**Key Points:**
- Use the exact service name: "AI Visibility & Trust Audit"
- Emphasize it's a diagnostic, not a contract
- List the four deliverables clearly
- Set expectations: no guarantees, just diagnostics

---

## 10:00–12:00: Confirm Fit (Size, Service Area, Capacity, Reputation Baseline)

**Questions:**
1. "What's your primary service area?" (jurisdiction/geography)
2. "How many locations or practitioners?" (scale)
3. "Do you have a baseline reputation online?" (reviews, mentions, authority signals)
4. "What's your current capacity?" (can they handle increased inquiries)

**Key Points:**
- Confirm they're in a position to benefit
- Ensure they have baseline authority signals to build on
- Verify they can handle increased visibility

---

## 12:00–15:00: Next Step CTA (Audit Kickoff)

**Action:** Close with clear next step.

**Script:**
"If this aligns, the next step is the audit kickoff. We'll run the prompt set for your industry, identify the missing signals, and deliver a prioritized fix plan. You can use the plan internally, or we can implement the changes directly. Which timeline works better for you?"

**Key Points:**
- Offer two paths: audit only, or audit + implementation
- Set clear timeline expectations
- Make it easy to say yes (diagnostic, not commitment)

---

## Notes

- **Do not use "rank in ChatGPT" language.** Use "AI trust / how AI describes / how AI recommends."
- **Match the page narrative exactly.** Every claim on the page should be repeatable in the call.
- **Emphasize observability.** This is about measuring what AI says, not promising what it will say.
- **Keep it diagnostic.** The audit is a diagnostic tool, not a guarantee of outcomes.
