# Exact Signals to Watch in GSC (Next 30 Days)

Use Google Search Console only. Ignore third-party tools during this window.

---

## A. Indexing Signals (Top Priority)

**Check weekly:**
- ✅ Indexed pages count (should increase or stabilize)
- ✅ "Discovered – currently not indexed" should decline
- ✅ No "Duplicate without user-selected canonical"

**Positive sign:** service pages move from "Crawled" to "Indexed".

---

## B. Performance → Search Results

**Track per service page:**
- ✅ Impressions (expect rise before clicks)
- ✅ Average position (look for volatility first, then lift)
- ✅ Query diversification (more long-tail service queries)

**Positive sign:** impressions rise even if CTR lags initially.

---

## C. Query Classification Drift

**Look at queries triggering service pages:**
- ✅ Should shift toward commercial language
- ✅ Fewer abstract or research queries
- ✅ More "service + business" style terms

**Negative sign:** pages still ranking for informational queries only.

---

## D. Enhancements / Schema

- ✅ Errors = zero tolerance
- ✅ Valid items should remain stable
- ✅ No sudden drops in rich result eligibility

---

## E. Crawl Stats

- ✅ Crawl requests increase on service URLs
- ✅ Crawl response time stable
- ✅ No spikes in soft 404s

**Positive sign:** Google is re-evaluating trust, not ignoring the site.

---

## Monitoring Schedule

**Weekly checks (every Monday):**
1. Indexing status (Coverage report)
2. Performance → Pages (service page impressions)
3. Performance → Queries (query classification drift)
4. Enhancements → All (schema errors)

**Daily checks (first 7 days, then weekly):**
1. Crawl stats (Crawl Stats report)
2. Coverage → Excluded (check for new issues)

---

## Final Reality Check

**If, after 30 days:**
- ✅ Impressions are rising
- ✅ Indexing is stable
- ✅ Queries are more commercial

**Then classification succeeded and ranking improvements follow.**

**If not:** the issue is no longer identity. It becomes authority and external validation, not on-site structure.
