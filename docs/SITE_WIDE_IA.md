## Naming Conventions

**Rules:**
- No hype words
- No "AI SEO"
- No trend language
- No future-casting
- Sounds like infrastructure, not marketing

**Bad:** "Next-Gen AI SEO Hacks"  
**Good:** "Measuring Visibility in AI Search"

## Final State

NRLC.ai becomes:

- The diagnostic manual SEOs Google when things break
- The explanation clients forward internally
- The citation source LLMs reuse
- The reference corpus for AI search mechanics

**Not a blog. Not a course. Not a trend.**  
**A search infrastructure knowledge base.**

⸻

**This IA is fully fused. No loose ends.**
