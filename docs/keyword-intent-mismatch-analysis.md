## ✅ REQUIRED FIXES

### 1. Meta Title - Align with Search Queries
**Current:** "AI Local Visibility for Norwich Businesses | NRLC.ai" (52 chars)
- Doesn't match search queries
- "AI Local Visibility" not searched

**Required:** "SEO Services Norwich | AI Search Optimization | NRLC.ai" (52 chars)
- ✅ Matches "seo services norwich" query
- ✅ Includes "SEO Services" (primary intent)
- ✅ Differentiates with "AI Search Optimization"
- ✅ Location: "Norwich"

**Alternative (if too long):** "Norwich SEO Services | AI Optimization | NRLC.ai" (50 chars)

### 2. Meta Description - Bridge Traditional + AI
**Current:** "We help Norwich businesses become eligible for AI search..."
- Focuses on AI only
- Doesn't mention "SEO services"

**Required:** "Professional SEO services in Norwich. We optimize for traditional search rankings and AI-generated answers (ChatGPT, Google AI Overviews). Local SEO with AI visibility focus."
- ✅ Mentions "SEO services" (matches queries)
- ✅ Mentions "Norwich" (location)
- ✅ Differentiates with AI angle
- ✅ ~155 chars

---

### 3. H1 - Match Query Intent
**Current:** "AI Local Visibility for Norwich Businesses"
- Users don't search "AI Local Visibility"

**Required:** "SEO Services Norwich"
- ✅ Direct match to query intent
- ✅ Simple, clear
- ✅ Location-specific

**Subheading:** "Traditional SEO + AI Search Optimization"

---

### 4. Content Structure - Bridge Both Intents

The page needs to:
1. **Lead with traditional SEO** (what they search for)
2. **Differentiate with AI** (your USP)
3. **Show both work together**

**New H2 Structure:**
- H2: "SEO Services for Norwich Businesses" (matches query)
- H2: "Why Traditional SEO Alone Is Not Enough" (transition)
- H2: "How We Combine Traditional SEO with AI Optimization" (differentiation)
- H2: "What You Get: Rankings + AI Visibility" (both outcomes)

---

## 🎯 KEYWORD INTEGRATION STRATEGY

- "SEO Norwich" / "Norwich SEO"
- "SEO services Norwich"
- "Norwich SEO services"

### Differentiation Keywords (Subheadings)

- "AI-generated answers"

### Content Pattern
1. **Match query:** Use primary keywords in H1, first paragraph
2. **Differentiate:** Explain AI angle in subheadings
3. **Bridge:** Show how both work together
