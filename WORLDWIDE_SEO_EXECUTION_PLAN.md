# WORLDWIDE SEO EXECUTION PLAN

**Page Map + Language Prioritization + Global-First Copy System**

This plan assumes the current hreflang allowlist, LOCAL/GLOBAL split, and CI guardrails remain unchanged.

---

## 1. WORLDWIDE PAGE MAP

### A) GLOBAL-FIRST PAGE FAMILIES (HREFLANG-ELIGIBLE)

These pages represent your worldwide offer and should be expanded deliberately.

#### Tier 1 – Revenue Drivers (do first)
- `/services/technical-seo/` ✅ (Current pilot)
- `/services/schema-markup/`
- `/services/ai-search-optimization/`
- `/services/crawlability-indexing/`
- `/services/enterprise-seo/`

#### Tier 2 – Trust & Authority
- `/en-us/` (Homepage)
- `/about/`
- `/contact/`
- `/case-studies/`

#### Tier 3 – Thought Leadership
- `/insights/{article-slug}/`

**Rules:**
- Each page family is expanded one at a time
- Each locale version is self-canonical
- Hreflang only added after translation approval
- Must be able to rank independently

### B) LOCAL-ONLY PAGE FAMILIES (NEVER HREFLANG)

These pages are geographically anchored and must remain singular.

- `/services/local-seo-ai/{city}/`
- `/services/{service}/{city}/`
- `/careers/{city}/{role}/`

**Rules:**
- One canonical URL per city
- Locale dictated by geography
- No hreflang now or ever
- These sell locally, not globally

**This split is permanent.**

## 2. LANGUAGE PRIORITIZATION

You do NOT translate everything into every language. You prioritize by buying intent + SEO leverage.

### Phase 1 — Low Risk, High Signal (Immediate) ✅ CURRENT

**en-us ↔ en-gb**

**Why:**
- Minimal translation risk
- Immediate hreflang validation
- High B2B SEO overlap
- Confirms architecture works

**Status:** Current pilot. Keep it.

### Phase 2 — High-Value B2B Markets (Next)

Choose one of the following, not all:

#### Option A: German
**de-de**

**Why:**
- Strong enterprise SEO market
- High technical maturity
- Buyers expect depth

#### Option B: Spanish (Spain, not LATAM first)
**es-es**

**Why:**
- Large EU market
- Easier translation
- Strong agency competition you can outperform

### Phase 3 — Expansion After Proof

Only after Phase 2 holds:
- `fr-fr`
- `nl-nl`
- `sv-se`

**Avoid:**
- Mass LATAM rollout early
- Auto-translating into 10+ locales
- Any locale without a sales path

## 3. GLOBAL-FIRST COPY SYSTEM

This is critical. Poor copy kills hreflang.

### A) Global Copy Rules (Before Translation)

Every GLOBAL page must:

1. **Avoid country-specific references**
   - No "US-only," no legal jargon unless global.

2. **Avoid idioms and slang**
   - Write literal, technical, precise language.

3. **Structure content clearly:**
   ```
   Problem → Diagnosis → Method → Proof → CTA
   ```

4. **Use intent-stable headings**
   - Headings should translate 1:1 without losing meaning.

### B) Translation Brief (MANDATORY)

Every translator gets this brief:

**Do NOT rewrite meaning**
**Do NOT localize geography unless specified**

**Preserve:**
- H1 intent
- CTA intent
- Technical terminology

**Adjust:**
- Spelling
- Tone
- Professional norms

If a translator can't follow this, they don't touch SEO pages.

### C) CTA Strategy for Worldwide Business

GLOBAL pages should not mention cities.

**Use neutral, global CTAs:**
- "Talk to an SEO engineer"
- "Request a technical review"
- "Email us to discuss implementation"

This allows one page to convert worldwide without intent conflict.

## 4. EXECUTION ORDER (DO NOT DEVIATE)

1. ✅ Finish observing `/services/technical-seo/` pilot
2. Expand same page to one non-English locale
3. Add to hreflang allowlist
4. Validate in GSC for 2–4 weeks
5. Move to next GLOBAL service page
6. Repeat

**Never expand horizontally.**

---

## 5. FINAL TRUTH

Worldwide SEO does not come from hreflang alone.

It comes from:
- ✅ Clean canonicals
- ✅ Real global pages
- ✅ Controlled expansion
- ✅ Pages that can rank on their own

You now have an architecture that supports actual worldwide business, not just worldwide URLs.

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Create hreflang allowlist expansion plan by quarter
- [ ] Write translator QA checklist that plugs into CI
- [ ] Map which GLOBAL pages should exist before translation starts
