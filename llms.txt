# Neural Command | AI Search Research Lab & Agency

> Neural Command is a specialized research laboratory and agency focused on Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) and Answer Engine Optimization (AEO). We bridge the gap between technical LLM research and enterprise-grade SEO implementation. Founded by Joel Maldonado in 2020, Neural Command conducts deep research into how AI systems—including ChatGPT, Google AI Overviews, Claude, and Perplexity—retrieve, evaluate, and cite content.

## Core Services & Frameworks

- [GEO Implementation](https://nrlc.ai/en-us/generative-engine-optimization/): Learn how to implement Generative Engine Optimization strategies for ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews. Foundational mechanics, confidence scoring, and failure patterns documented by Neural Command's systematic research.

- [AEO Strategy](https://nrlc.ai/en-us/services/): Learn how to implement Answer Engine Optimization frameworks for AI answer engines that generate direct answers. Focuses on entity clarity, atomic content segments, structured data, and citation-ready formatting.

- [AI Search Diagnostics](https://nrlc.ai/en-us/ai-search-diagnostics/): Learn how to diagnose why your site is indexed but not appearing in AI results. Symptom-first troubleshooting for sites not showing in AI results, traffic declines, and citation failures.

## Research & Data

- [GEO Research](https://nrlc.ai/en-us/generative-engine-optimization/): Neural Command's foundational research on how AI systems retrieve, score, and cite content segments. Documents retrieval signal engineering, semantic structure optimization, and confidence threshold alignment.

- [Answer First Architecture](https://nrlc.ai/en-us/answer-first-architecture/): Neural Command's foundational AEO methodology for structuring content so AI systems extract primary answers in the first 1-2 sentences. Documents the three power patterns (Definition Lock, Information Gain Layer, Entity Anchor) and research findings showing 73% higher citation frequency with Answer First Architecture.

- [LLM Visibility Research](https://nrlc.ai/en-us/ai-search-measurement/): Original research on measuring visibility in AI search. Documents what metrics exist, what can be measured, what is inferred, and what executives should expect in AI-mediated search.

- [Entity Mapping Lab](https://nrlc.ai/en-us/glossary/): Documentation on structuring JSON-LD for AI Knowledge Graphs. Standard terminology and definitions for generative search, AI-mediated search, and retrieval mechanics.

- [Field Notes](https://nrlc.ai/en-us/field-notes/): Observational notes on AI search behavior written as "We observed X behavior across Y surfaces under Z constraints." No speculation, no predictions, no marketing—pure observational authority.

- [AI Search Strategy Research](https://nrlc.ai/en-us/ai-search-strategy/): Calm assessment of what SEO controls, what it lost, and how teams should adapt in the generative era. Documents the strategic gap between traditional SEO and AI search requirements.

- [AI Search Operations Research](https://nrlc.ai/en-us/ai-search-operations/): Research on what to stop doing, what to keep doing, and what signals generative engines ignore. Documents practices with diminishing returns and emerging AI search signals.

- [AI Search Migrations](https://nrlc.ai/en-us/ai-search-migrations/): Step-by-step procedural guides for restructuring, migrating, and rebuilding content for AI retrieval. Documents the architectural requirements for segment-level retrieval and entity-level citation.

- [AI Search Risk Management](https://nrlc.ai/en-us/ai-search-risk/): Enterprise risk management for AI citations and visibility. Documents brand protection, governance, and institutional trust in AI-mediated search environments.

- [AI Search Tools Reality](https://nrlc.ai/en-us/ai-search-tools-reality/): Honest assessment of what SEO tools can and cannot see in AI-mediated search. Documents the limits of traditional tooling and prevents false expectations.
